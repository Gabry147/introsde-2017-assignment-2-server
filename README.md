# SDE Second Assignment Delivery - Server 
#### Gabriele Scarton
###### gabriele.scarton@studenti.unitn.it
This is the second assignment for IntroSDE course at Unitn.
The goal of the assignment is to create a rest service composed by a server and a test client.
The server is deployed on Heroku at **sde2-2017-scarton.herokuapp.com**
## Specifications
  - Dependency manager: Ivy
  - Build tool: Ant
  - Rest framework: Jersey 
  - Database: Postgresql (provided by heroku)
  - Persistency unit implementation: Hibernate

##  The code structure
The server contains its _build.xml_ file, the _ivy.xml_ dependencies file, the source code and the _WebContent_ folder with the _web.xml_ file.
The it.gabry147 folder contains three packages:
  - **entities** contains the entities, the one that are saved in the db have also the specified functions to interact with the persistency unit.
  - **dao** contains the class with basic method for accessing the persistence data and a class for populate the db at deploy time. 
  - **resources** contains the Jersey-related code to process the request and a ServletContextListener implementation in order to call the class for db population
  - the last folder is the one which contains the persistence.xml file

## The code logic
//TODO

## How to run the code
> For security reason, the persistence.xml file does not contain the data of the db used. If you want to use this code, remember to modify the file, which is under /it/gabry147/META-INF

The server is packed into a .WAR file, automatically generated by Ant with the console command:
``` 
$ ant create.war 
```
